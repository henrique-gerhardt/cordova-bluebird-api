Cordova Bluebird Plugin
============

This is a Cordova/Phonegap plugin to interact with the BlueBird ruggedized devices' Barcode Scanners and Magnetic Stripe Readers.  It has been tested on a  BP30, with soon to be testing on a BP70.

=============

This plugin is compatible with plugman.  To install, run the following from your project command line: 
```$ cordova plugin add https://github.com/henrique-gerhardt/cordova-bluebird-api.git --nofetch```


==============

<h3>To Use:</h3>
You'll register a callback which will be called when a successful "read" event occurs on the scanner or magstripe reader.  

```
function loadBarcode(barcode) {
	console.log("barcode read : " + barcode);
	//TODO: handle barcode read
}
function handleMagstripeTracks(tracks) {
	console.log("read magstripe value : " + JSON.stringify(tracks));
   
	//read track 1
	var track1 = tracks[0].split('^');
	if (track1.length == 1)  {
		window.magstripe.read(function(){});
		return;
	}
	
	var cc = {
		number : track1[0].substr(1),
		name : track1[1].trim(),
		expr : '20' + track1[2].substr(0,2) + '-' + track1[2].substr(2,2)
	};
	console.log("read credit card " + JSON.stringify(cc));
	//TODO: handle magstripe
}
document.addEventListener("deviceready", function(){ 
	if (window.bluebirdBarcodeScanner) {
		console.log("initializing barcode scanner")
		bluebirdBarcodeScanner.register(loadBarcode, function (argument) {
			console.log("failed to register barcode scanner");
		});
	}
	 
	if (window.bluebirdMagstripe) {
		console.log("initializing magstripe")
		bluebirdMagstripe.register(handleMagstripeTracks, function (argument) {
				console.log("failed to register for mag stripe reader");
		});	
	}
}, false);
```

=============
<h3>More API options:</h3>

<h5>Magstripe:</h5>
* You need to "activate" the reader, by calling `bluebirdMagstripe.read()` when you need to read a credit card (for instance, on a checkout page).  A succcessful read will call your registration callback.

<h5>Scanner:</h5>
* You can wire a soft button to the barcode scanner by calling `bluebirdBarcodeScanner.softScanOn()`
* Turn off the scanner manually using: `bluebirdBarcodeScanner.softScanOff()`
